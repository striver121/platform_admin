# Goldilocks, recommendations on workloads rightsizing.

How can this help with my resource settings?
By using the kubernetes vertical-pod-autoscaler in recommendation mode, we can see a suggestion for resource requests on each of our apps. This tool creates a VPA for each workload in a namespace and then queries them for information.

Once your VPAs are in place, you'll see recommendations appear in the Goldilocks dashboard
